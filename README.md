# M5-Competion

This is the final file Version 1 out of 3 where in we built a bagged models for 4 different Learning Rate + 1 model with the poisson distribution ( with the d features amd hp filter fetaures). The idea of bagging is to reduce the overfitting and generates a solid outputs, we did the cross validation of marking the last 28 days as test and train the models on the rest. The interesting thing in this competition is that , we took changes the whole validation strategy in 2 days before the competition as the validation strategy we adopted was highly basis on seeds and did not generate the good outcome on the private dataset.
